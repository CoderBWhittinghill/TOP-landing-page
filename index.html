         <h4>How someone with no college education was able to lean coding.</h4>
             <p>"How could I possibly learn to be a coder?" "Doesn't someone need a college education to code?" These are all statements or excuses that I made whenever I thought about learning how to code; I'm here to tell you that it's not true. <em>Absolutley Not True!</em> Anybody can learn to code and it's just a matter of finding the right resources.</p>

         <h4>My Trading Journey; What I am doing to become a Professional Prop Trader.</h4>
             <p>With all of the economic turmoil brewing in the world, it makes sense to have multiple ways of diversifying and managing your money. One way is with stock trading for aggressive growth, hedging the market with metals such as gold or commodities such as oil. Through learning about these various methods of diversification; I found the Forex Market which trades in currencies. After trying it out and demo trading, I set out to find a mentor and learn the best way to trade these instraments. Thus began my road to becoming a professional forex prop trader using technical analysis and a personal algorithm to tell when and how to trade.</p>
         <h4>Who am I and what is my trading philosophy?</h4>
             <p>My name is Brandon, I am a father, a husband, a trader, a hiker, and an all around crazy individual; so take heed anything I say, <em>LOL</em>. My strategies are design to take profits quickly and not stay in any position for too long. This is called "Swing trading" and is my favorite way of trading thus far. My greatest struggle has been in fing out how to properly trade each instrument.How one trades stocks, is not the same as how they would (or should)trade commodities or currencies. It has taken me approx 2-3 years of research, backtesting, and studying how the markets work; and only now am I starting to be able to create the algorithms for the various instruments. </p>
